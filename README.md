# Software-Defined-Network-Using-Cloudiot
The integration of cloud and Internet of Things (IoT), named CloudIoT, has been 
considered as an enabler for many different applications. However, the suspicion about the 
security issue is one main concern that some organizations hesitate to adopt such technologies 
while some just ignore the security issue while integrating the CloudIoT into their business. 
Therefore, given the numerous choices of cloud-resource providers and IoT devices, how to 
evaluate their security level becomes an important issue to promote the adoption of CloudIoT 
as well as reduce the business security risks. To solve this problem, considering the importance 
of the business data in CloudIoT, we develop an end-to-end security assessment framework 
based on software defined network (SDN) to evaluate the security level for the given CloudIoT 
offering. Specially, in order to simplify the network controls and focus on the analysis about 
the data flow through CloudIoT, we develop a three-layer framework by integrating SDN and 
CloudIoT, which consists of 23 different indicators to describe its security features. Then, the 
interviews from industry and academic are carried out to understand the importance of these 
features for the overall security. Furthermore, given the relevant evidences from the CloudIoT 
offering, the Google Brillo and Microsoft Azure IoT Suite, our framework can effectively 
evaluate the security level which can help the consumers for their CloudIoT selection. Due to 
the complexity of the CouldIoT solutions, how to evaluate the security level is a non-trivial 
task for the consumers. Some organizations will hesitate to adopt such technology due to the 
suspicion about the security and the incomprehension ofrisk, which may harm the development 
of the related business as well as affect the acceptance of the CloudIoT. Conversely, some 
organizations may just integrated CloudIoT into their business without considering the security 
issue, resulting into high risk for them.
